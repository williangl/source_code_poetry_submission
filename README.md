# Source Code Poetry
An Event to write poetry using code.
https://www.sourcecodepoetry.com/

## Rules
- Any coding language
  -  However, we accept poems written in interpreted programming languages
- Must compile
  - The executed code-poem must give a result
- Must Rhyme
  - However, modern masterpieces bend the norms


## How to execute
Just exec:
```shell
python code_poetry.py
```

Output:
```
days.that_you_feel('gray')='Like sky in the rain'
days.that_you_feel('bad')="when='2021/10/10' a hug is not so bad"
And a suport phrase could help!! ðŸ«‚
```
